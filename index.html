	<p>And now I will tell you about my friend in the Eight Grades. <br>

	But in the eighth grade I have some bestfriends.My Bestfriends name is mahdi.dhani.bima.tomy dll. We often play together at mahdi's house and we often call our name group as FTF, in fact I also do not know the meaning, but I it's okay for me.</p>

	<br>
	Then when the ninth grade is the most funny class because my friend is very much, not only in one class, I also have friends in other class. As class I have 2 BestCamp at home Shidiq and Ica House. But I often play in shidiq's house rather than Ica House.
